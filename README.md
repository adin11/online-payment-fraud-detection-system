# Online Fraud Detection Model Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Online Fraud Detection App** is a machine learning-powered system designed to identify fraudulent transactions in real time. Built with **Streamlit**, it provides an interactive user interface where users can input transaction details and receive instant fraud predictions. The model analyzes transaction patterns and classifies them as **fraudulent** or **legitimate** based on trained data. This project aims to enhance online security and prevent financial fraud effectively.

## 📂 Repository Contents

- **`streamlit app.py`** - The main file to run the Streamlit web application.
- **`model.pkl`** - Pickle file containing the trained machine learning model.
- **`fraud_detection.ipynb`** - Jupyter Notebook showcasing the model training process.
- **`requirements.txt`** - List of required Python dependencies.

## 📊 How It Works

1. The user inputs transaction details into the **Streamlit** UI.
2. The trained **machine learning model** processes the input.
3. The model predicts whether the transaction is **fraudulent** or **legitimate**.
4. The result is displayed instantly on the web interface.
